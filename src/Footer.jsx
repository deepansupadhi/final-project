To help you with this, we offer a wide range of home décor items that will elevate the look of your home with elements that reflect your personality.

While the adage goes ‘home is where the heart is’ for some ‘home is where the art is.’ If you’re a patron of the arts, we are a furniture store that encourages your passion and offers myriad solutions to help you display and grow your collection. From photo frames and panels that will dutifully hold your valuable art to ethnic prints, to prints, paintings, figurines, and sculptures that will add to your existing collection, we have it all.

Plant your own little garden by perusing through our collection of planters and pots and picking out plants to your heart’s content.

If you’ve got a garden you’d like to rejuvenate, we carry items to decorate your corner of greenery, including everything from tiny knick-knacks to full-sized fountains. And if you can’t keep a plant alive to save your life, we’ve got a vast selection of artificial plants and artificial flowers for you to choose from, so you can enjoy freshness in your home without any worry.

Fulfil your spiritual needs: You might be hard-pressed to find a furniture shop that considers every facet of your life, including spirituality. However, at Pepperfry, you can rest assured that we’ve thought of it all. Whether you’re looking for festive décor to jazz up your home for the celebrations or temples, idols, and tokens to enrich your daily rituals, we have it all.

Awaken the chef within: Since the cornerstone of any home is the kitchen, how you decorate it can have a profound impact on your living experience. As a furniture shop, we offer utensils and kitchenware that make preparing and serving meals an experience that is delightful and memorable.

Whether you’re looking for durable cookware and bakeware like pots, pans, tins, and moulds, or exquisite dinner sets and premium cutlery, we meet all your culinary requirements.

If you want to set up a bar area, we offer a selection of glasses, shakers, bar stools, carafes, and more items than you ever imagined. From essentials like salt and pepper shakers to ornamental furnishings like table linens, with us you can find anything you could want for your kitchen.

From Furnishing to Lighting, Find Everything at Once
Unlike most furniture shops, we believe in helping you set up your space holistically and extend ourselves to cover every aspect of setting up your home. We offer a plethora of furnishing options, including bed sheets and bed linens of different sizes. From matching sets to individual pieces, you can pick as per your preference and set up your bedding in colours and styles you find soothing.

We also carry a vast collection of cushion covers and quilts that make sleeping as stylish as it is restful. Whether you’re looking for carpets to cover up awkward floor space or runners to embellish your corridors, we are one of the few home décor stores that can help you tick everything off your shopping list.

As anyone with even the slightest experience will tell you, lighting can make or break the overall look and feel of a space. As a home décor store, we not only understand this sentiment, but also offer lighting solutions designed to elevate your home’s aesthetics.

Whether you’re looking for floor lighting to set an ambience or ceiling lighting to add a touch of elegance, you can find ample options at our furniture showroom. From modern LED lights to smart lighting for efficient energy use, we take brightening your home to a whole new level.

Find Ways to Embrace the New and Efficient for your Home!
